 abstract = {Let x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>,⋯ be independent random variables which under P<sub>θ</sub> have probability density function of the form P<sub>θ</sub>{x<sub>k</sub> ∈ dx} = exp(θ x - Ψ(θ)) dH(x), where Ψ is normalized so that Ψ(0) = Ψ'(0) = 0. Let <latex>$a \leqq 0 < b, s_n = \sum^n_1 x_k$</latex>, and <tex-math>$T = \inf \{n: s_n \not\in (a, b)\}.$</tex-math> For <latex>$u < 0$</latex>, an unbiased Monte Carlo estimate of P<sub>u</sub>(s<sub>T</sub> ≥ b) is the average of independent P<sub>θ</sub>-realizations of I<sub>{s<sub>T</sub> ≥ b}</sub> exp{(u - θ)s<sub>T</sub> - T(Ψ(u) - Ψ(θ))}. It is shown that the choice θ = w, where <latex>$w > 0$</latex> is defined by Ψ(w) = Ψ(u), is an asymptotically (as b → ∞) optimal choice of θ in a sense to be defined. Implications of this result for Monte Carlo studies in sequential analysis are discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract We propose a robust implementation of the Nerlove-Arrow model using a Bayesian structural time series model to explain the relationship between advertising expenditures of a countrywide fast-food franchise network with its weekly sales. Due to the flexibility and modularity of the model, it is well suited to generalization to other markets or situations. Its Bayesian nature facilitates incorporating a priori information reflecting the manager's views, which can be updated with relevant data. This aspect of the model will be used to support the decision of the manager on the budget scheduling of the advertising firm across time and channels.},

abstract = "The variational auto-encoder (VAE) is a powerful and scalable deep generative model. Under the architecture of VAE, the choice of the approximate posterior distribution is one of the crucial issues, and it has a significant impact on tractability and flexibility of the VAE. Generally, latent variables are assumed to be normally distributed with a diagonal covariance matrix, however, it is not flexible enough to match the true complex posterior distribution. We introduce a novel approach to design a flexible and arbitrarily complex approximate posterior distribution. Unlike VAE, firstly, an initial density is constructed by a Gaussian mixture model, and each component has a diagonal covariance matrix. Then this relatively simple distribution is transformed into a more flexible one by applying a sequence of invertible Householder transformations until the desired complexity has been achieved. Additionally, we also give a detailed theoretical and geometric interpretation of Householder transformations. Lastly, due to this change of approximate posterior distribution, the Kullback–Leibler distance between two mixture densities is required to be calculated, but it has no closed form solution. Therefore, we redefine a new variational lower bound by virtue of its upper bound. Compared with other generative models based on similar VAE architecture, our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Omniglot and Histopathology data a more challenging medical images dataset, the experimental results show that our method can improve the flexibility of posterior distribution more effectively."

It is a decision-theoretic alternative to game theory. ARA enables an analyst to express her Bayesian beliefs about an opponent's utilities, capabilities, probabilities, and the type of strategic calculations that the opponent is using to make his decision. Within that framework, the analyst then solves the problem from the perspective of the opponent. This calculation produces a distribution over the actions of the opponent that permits the analyst to maximize her expected utility. This review covers conceptual, modeling, computational, and applied issues in ARA as well as interesting open research issues.

abstract = {Deep neural networks (NNs) are powerful black box predictors that have recently achieved impressive performance on a wide spectrum of tasks. Quantifying predictive uncertainty in NNs is a challenging and yet unsolved problem. Bayesian NNs, which learn a distribution over weights, are currently the state-of-the-art for estimating predictive uncertainty; however these require significant modifications to the training procedure and are computationally expensive compared to standard (non-Bayesian) NNs. We propose an alternative to Bayesian NNs that is simple to implement, readily parallelizable, requires very little hyperparameter tuning, and yields high quality predictive uncertainty estimates. Through a series of experiments on classification and regression benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates which are as good or better than approximate Bayesian NNs. To assess robustness to dataset shift, we evaluate the predictive uncertainty on test examples from known and unknown distributions, and show that our method is able to express higher uncertainty on out-of-distribution examples. We demonstrate the scalability of our method by evaluating predictive uncertainty estimates on ImageNet.},

In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.} }

abstract = {Abstract Nonlinear principal component analysis is a novel technique for multivariate data analysis, similar to the well-known method of principal component analysis. NLPCA, like PCA, is used to identify and remove correlations among problem variables as an aid to dimensionality reduction, visualization, and exploratory data analysis. While PCA identifies only linear correlations between variables, NLPCA uncovers both linear and nonlinear correlations, without restriction on the character of the nonlinearities present in the data. NLPCA operates by training a feedforward neural network to perform the identity mapping, where the network inputs are reproduced at the output layer. The network contains an internal “bottleneck” layer (containing fewer nodes than input or output layers), which forces the network to develop a compact representation of the input data, and two additional hidden layers. The NLPCA method is demonstrated using time-dependent, simulated batch reaction data. Results show that NLPCA successfully reduces dimensionality and produces a feature space map resembling the actual distribution of the underlying system parameters.},

Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.} }

However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs – extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout’s uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout’s uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.} }

ABSTRACT = {Adversarial classification (AC) is a major subfield within the increasingly important domain of adversarial machine learning (AML). So far, most approaches to AC have followed a classical game-theoretic framework. This requires unrealistic common knowledge conditions untenable in the security settings typical of the AML realm. After reviewing such approaches, we present alternative perspectives on AC based on adversarial risk analysis.},

ABSTRACT = {In this work, a framework to boost the efficiency of Bayesian inference in probabilistic models is introduced by embedding a Markov chain sampler within a variational posterior approximation. We call this framework &ldquo;refined variational approximation&rdquo;. Its strengths are its ease of implementation and the automatic tuning of sampler parameters, leading to a faster mixing time through automatic differentiation. Several strategies to approximate evidence lower bound (ELBO) computation are also introduced. Its efficient performance is showcased experimentally using state-space models for time-series data, a variational encoder for density estimation and a conditional variational autoencoder as a deep Bayes classifier.},

    abstract = { Building intelligent systems that are capable of extracting high-level representations from high-dimensional sensory data lies at the core of solving many artificial intelligence–related tasks, including object recognition, speech perception, and language understanding. Theoretical and biological arguments strongly suggest that building such systems requires models with deep architectures that involve many layers of nonlinear processing. In this article, we review several popular deep learning models, including deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines. We show that (a) these deep generative models, which contain many layers of latent variables and millions of parameters, can be learned efficiently, and (b) the learned high-level feature representations can be successfully applied in many application domains, including visual object recognition, information retrieval, classification, and regression tasks. }

    abstract = { An influence diagram is a network representation for probabilistic and decision analysis models. The nodes correspond to variables which can be constants, uncertain quantities, decisions, or objectives. The arcs reveal the probabilistic dependence of the uncertain quantities and the information available at the time of the decisions. The detailed data about the variables are stored within the nodes, so the diagram graph is compact and focuses attention on the relationships among the variables. Influence diagrams are effective communication tools and recent developments also allow them to be used for analysis. We develop algorithms to address questions of inference within a probabilistic model represented as an influence diagram. We use the conditional independence implied by the diagram's structure to determine the information needed to solve a given problem. When there is enough information we can solve it, exploiting that conditional independence. These same results are applied to problems of decision analysis. This methodology allows the construction of computer tools to maintain and evaluate complex models. }

abstract = "This work offers a broad perspective on probabilistic modeling and inference in light of recent advances in probabilistic programming, in which models are formally expressed in Turing-complete programming languages. We consider a typical workflow and how probabilistic programming languages can help to automate this workflow, especially in the matching of models with inference methods. We focus on two properties of a model that are critical in this matching: its structure—the conditional dependencies between random variables—and its form—the precise mathematical definition of those dependencies. While the structure and form of a probabilistic model are often fixed a priori, it is a curiosity of probabilistic programming that they need not be, and may instead vary according to random choices made during program execution. We introduce a formal description of models expressed as programs, and discuss some of the ways in which probabilistic programming languages can reveal the structure and form of these, in order to tailor inference methods. We demonstrate the ideas with a new probabilistic programming language called Birch, with a multiple object tracking example."

  abstract = 	 {While it’s always possible to compute a variational approximation to a posterior distribution, it can be difficult to discover problems with this approximation. We propose two diagnostic algorithms to alleviate this problem. The Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS) diagnostic gives a goodness of fit measurement for joint distributions, while simultaneously improving the error in the estimate. The variational simulation-based calibration (VSBC) assesses the average performance of point estimates.}

abstract = "Learning-based pattern classifiers, including deep networks, have shown impressive performance in several application domains, ranging from computer vision to cybersecurity. However, it has also been shown that adversarial input perturbations carefully crafted either at training or at test time can easily subvert their predictions. The vulnerability of machine learning to such wild patterns (also referred to as adversarial examples), along with the design of suitable countermeasures, have been investigated in the research field of adversarial machine learning. In this work, we provide a thorough overview of the evolution of this research area over the last ten years and beyond, starting from pioneering, earlier work on the security of non-deep learning algorithms up to more recent work aimed to understand the security properties of deep learning algorithms, in the context of computer vision and cybersecurity tasks. We report interesting connections between these apparently-different lines of work, highlighting common misconceptions related to the security evaluation of machine-learning algorithms. We review the main threat models and attacks defined to this end, and discuss the main limitations of current work, along with the corresponding future challenges towards the design of more secure learning algorithms."

abstract = {The field of machine learning is progressing at a faster pace than ever before. Many organizations leverage machine learning tools to extract useful information from a massive amount of data. In particular, machine learning finds its application in cybersecurity that begins to enter the age of automation. However, machine learning applications in cybersecurity face unique challenges other domains rarely do—attacks from active adversaries. Problems in areas such as intrusion detection, banking fraud detection, spam filtering, and malware detection have to face challenges of adversarial attacks that modify data so that malicious instances would evade detection by the learning systems. The adversarial learning problem naturally resembles a game between the learning system and the adversary. In such a game, both players would attempt to play their best strategies against each other while maximizing their own payoffs. To solve the game, each player would search for an optimal strategy against the opponent based on the prediction of the opponent's strategy choice. The problem becomes even more complicated in settings where the learning system may have to deal with many adversaries of unknown types. Applying game-theoretic approach, robust learning techniques have been developed to specifically address adversarial attacks and the preliminary results are promising. In this review, we summarize these results. This article is categorized under: Technologies > Machine Learning Fundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge > Key Design Issues in Data Mining},

publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {Forecasting models play a key role in money-making ventures in many different markets. Such models are often trained on data from various sources, some of which may be untrustworthy. An actor in a given market may be incentivised to drive predictions in a certain direction to their own benefit. Prior analyses of intelligent adversaries in a machine-learning context have focused on regression and classification. In this paper we address the non-iid setting of time series forecasting. We consider a forecaster, Bob, using a fixed, known model and a recursive forecasting method. An adversary, Alice, aims to pull Bob's forecasts toward her desired target series, and may exercise limited influence on the initial values fed into Bob's model. We consider the class of linear autoregressive models, and a flexible framework of encoding Alice's desires and constraints. We describe a method of calculating Alice's optimal attack that is computationally tractable, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness compared to random and greedy baselines on synthetic and real-world time series data. We conclude by discussing defensive strategies in the face of Alice-like adversaries.},

The problem is first distinguished from that of response surface methodology. With regard to the analysis of data, topics that are discussed include the behavior of estimated constants with an inadequate model, a diagnostic technique for model-building, and the importance of visual scrutiny of data. With regard to the generation of data, the concept of placing a model in jeopardy is discussed. Designs for model discrimination and for parameter estimation are considered.},

abstract = {Currently available methods for extracting saliency maps identify parts of the input which are the most important to a specific fixed classifier. We show that this strong dependence on a given classifier hinders their performance. To address this problem, we propose classifier-agnostic saliency map extraction, which finds all parts of the image that any classifier could use, not just one given in advance. We observe that the proposed approach extracts higher quality saliency maps than prior work while being conceptually simple and easy to implement. The method sets the new state of the art result for localization task on the ImageNet data, outperforming all existing weakly-supervised localization techniques, despite not using the ground truth labels at the inference time. The code reproducing the results is available at https://github.com/kondiz/casme.}
